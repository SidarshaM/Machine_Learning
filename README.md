# Weather Prediction -Predicting it will Rain or not using some Weather Conditons.
*Machine Learning Project 
*Purpose of this project is to predict the temperature using logical regression.
*Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks
  where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not.
  This algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks, such as identifying whether an email is spam or not ,
  and diagnosing diseases by assessing the presence or absence of specific conditions based on patient test results.
*The output "weather" value is based on features "precipitation,temp_max,temp_min and wind".
